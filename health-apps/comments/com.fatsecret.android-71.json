I don\\'t know if they are doing server updates every morning or not but it is highly annoying.  Being able to enter in food this easy makes sure I will accurately track both food and exercise. Easy to use. Wish it could only change my RDI from this point on, like a saved calendar item works. Do you want to change all RDIs outer only from this point on?",

      "cmt": "Great overall, but with 2 issues that, once addressed, would really put this over the top. First - the RDI for me was WAY WAY off. Putting in all my info, it recommended 2800 calories a day, and that\\'s for being sedentary and trying to lose weight. Putting in the same weight, height, age, etc into any other calorie calculator I\\'ve tried all tells me about 1900-2000 a day, a pretty huge difference. But hey, FatSecret lets you manually adjust their RDI after it\\'s calculated, so that\\'s fine. Just don\\'t trust their calculations.  The other thing I hate is having to put in the same items over and over for \\'combined foods\\' like sandwiches, hotdogs with relish, etc. I\\'d rather be able to select a group of foods, call it \\\"Turkey Sandwich\\\" and save it for later, then just click my Turkey Sandwich every time I fix one. Grouping like that would be a huge plus for people that do a lot of home-cooked meals, especially if a generic version can\\'t be found through the search option.  Other than those 2 things, I love it.",
