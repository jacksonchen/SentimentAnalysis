      "cmt": "Awesome job of recording locations to later match to photos whether at stationary locations or shooting from a fast moving tour bus. 1 second granularity is available. I use this app often in the USA and recently in Singapore and Malaysia. 4 stars because I need to transfer GPX files and exporting and sending to my computer is very clumsy. The app is set up for auto transfer to Google Drive and I would give 5 stars if if could select the transfer file format to be GPX not just KML. Note that this app does not do any of the time synchronizing nor embedding of Geo positions into photos - I use other software on the PC for that.",

Wish they\\'d add the route to the image when sharing (now it\\'s just a blank map).  Update: It is now the best performer of all I\\'ve tried, but unfortunately they went a different (wrong) direction and even removed the map image when sharing to Facebook and other social media accounts. There is just a link to the route in your Google Drive account. Not a good move.",
