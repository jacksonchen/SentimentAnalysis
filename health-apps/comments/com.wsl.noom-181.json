      "cmt": "Its amazing to see how much you actually overeat when it comes to calories. Diet is 90% of the effort in weight control. Slogging it in the gym helps but isn\\'t the key. Would give 5 stars if they had a setting to use kg with miles. Instead of having to use a separate app for conversion. Food tracker widget is also poor quality, looks like a child drew it. Customer service I don\\'t think they have heard of either.",

It helped me to live healthier. Now, noom is almost unrecognizable to me. The forum is gone, so no more dozens of topics to talk about.  We only get one article, the rest aren\\'t available unless we pay . Hate it. Everything is about going pro! $10 a month? Smh.",

      "cmt": "I wish noom included a water intake tracker. Also, calorie density is a great way to watch what you\\'re eating, but some healthier foods like flaxseed show up red because of their density among other foods that are mostly unhealthy.  You can\\'t rely on the app to know that your diet is healthy, you still have to do some research.  Fitness log is great but I wonder about the accuracy of calorie counts per exercise.  I\\'m not willing to spend $10/month on pro, but free app could have more features.",

With this app you can buckle down, diet like a fitness-freak and have fun while you\\'re doing it. What I like the most is how it encourages you to be the best you can be and how you can log the food  you eat. Other apps require pay to just TRY IT and that doesn\\'t make anyone want to work out, but with Noom you\\'ll want to eat healthy, you\\'ll want to look forward to exercising and you WILL lose weight!",

I was right on my way to purchase the Pro Version (which I thought was about $1.99) and then I saw it was $10 a month!. This is crazy and really overpriced. You should atleast have a few new recipes each day for the free version. 3 stars for the app itself, cause I really enjoy it. 2 stars for not having the recipes available to the free users and for being overpriced.",

When adding foods, the sidebar overlaps the search options, so it\\'s hard to know what I\\'m selecting. Also, a tablet is not as easy to carry about on walks and runs, so perhaps an option to use a different pedometer and later input your steps? Although this may be unnecessary as you can input several exercise options including walking and running. Overall, I like it, but things need work.",
