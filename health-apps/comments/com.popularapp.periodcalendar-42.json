It has mood and symptom trackers which are really helpful, and is very accurate at predicting.  The one feature it lacks is a doozy, and that\\'s the ability to override ovulation based on your luteal phase being longer or shorter (as mine is).  So when I do ovulate (which I can feel), I have to pit it in the notes, so my calendar isn\\'t correct at a glance.  If it had that one key feature, it\\'d be 5 stars.",
