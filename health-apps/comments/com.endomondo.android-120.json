      "cmt": "I run endomondo on a blackberry Torch 9800 and on the samsung galaxy S2. It sems a bit more reliable on the blackberry but sometimes it also fails to aquire gps signal on the BB. The samsung galaxy S2 is even worst, it almost never picks up the gps and if it does it drops it continously so when I get to my first mile it says I only have .7 miles, so until they fix the gps acuracy on the software I raye this below average. When it works is awesome though.",

      "cmt": "I love the design of this app - it\\'s better than anything else of its type. However, on my device (Galaxy S3 running Cyanogenmod) the distance measurements are inaccurate and unreliable. It is not uncommon for the voice coach to tell me I ran a mile in 8:43 only to have the UI show me I ran that mile in 8:27. Also, it seems to lose its GPS signal every 3rd or 4th time I go out. All of my other location based apps work fine.",
